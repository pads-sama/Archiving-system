            Thesis and capstone projects are an integral part of the Bachelor of
            Science in Information Technology (BSIT) and Bachelor of Science in
            Computer Science (Com.Sci) programs. These projects provide students
            with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have
            acquired throughout their coursework to real-world problems and
            projects. In the BSIT and Com.Sci programs, students typically work on
            a thesis or capstone project during their final year of study, and the
            project is often completed in collaboration with industry partners or
            clients. The thesis or capstone project requires students to research,
            design, implement, and present a solution to a specific problem or
            challenge, demonstrating their ability to apply theoretical concepts
            to practical situations. By completing a thesis or capstone project,
            BSIT and Com.Sci students can showcase their knowledge and skills to
            potential employers and make valuable contributions to the field of
            technology.
